Hi! 👋 This documentation will help us understand your the project architecture, endpoints, and main routes.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### 📝 Description

In this async challenge, you will build a full-stack mini-app to manage patients, medications, and their treatment assignments for a digital health workflow.

You will implement CRUD APIs using NestJS with a SQLite database (already configured) and a minimal Next.js frontend to interact with these APIs. A patient can have multiple medication assignments, and you will implement logic to calculate the remaining days of each treatment automatically.

The goal is to evaluate your ability to:

- Deliver clear, scalable, maintainable code.

- Handle clean API design and testing.

- Build a simple, functional UI connected to your backend.

- Manage your workflow independently with clear commits.

This test simulates real work at Oxyera: you will receive a task, execute it end-to-end, and submit it for review, demonstrating your ownership and technical skills without requiring continuous oversight.

### ✅ What will you implement 

✅ **Backend (NestJS, runs on port **`8080`**)**

- CRUD endpoints for:
  - `Patient` (name, date of birth)
  - `Medication` (name, dosage, frequency)
  - `Assignment` (assign a medication to a patient with a start date and number of days)
- **A patient can have multiple medication assignments**.
- Endpoint to calculate and return **remaining days of treatment** for each assignment (based on start date + days - today).
- Endpoints should:
  - Return clear, structured JSON.
  - Validate input (e.g., required fields, valid dates).
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - Be covered with at least **one unit test for calculation logic**.

✅ **Frontend (Next.js, runs on port **`3000`**)**

- Multiple pages with Tailwind for styling.
- Features:
  - List patients with their assignments and remaining treatment days.
  - Forms to create:
    - Patients
    - Medications
    - Assign medications to patients.
- Display **remaining treatment days clearly per assignment**.
- Use a **global constant for backend URL** for clarity.

✅ Use the **SQLite DB already configured in** `/backend/database.sqlite`.

✅ Commit clearly and progressively, showing your reasoning in your commit messages.

✅ Use **TypeScript** everywhere.

✅ Structure your code cleanly to reflect scalability.

## ⚡ What We’re Evaluating

- Clear and scalable folder structure.
- Proper API design and HTTP handling.
- Input validation and error handling.
- Consistent, readable code.
- Use of TypeScript types for safety.
- Test quality and coverage of core logic.
- Ability to deliver a working feature with clean commits.
- UI clarity and correct functional connection with your backend.

## 🚀 Running the Project

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Access on `http://localhost:8080`.

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access on `http://localhost:3000`.

The SQLite database is located at `backend/database.sqlite`.
